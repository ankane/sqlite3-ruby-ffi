# sqlite3-ruby-ffi

:tada: A drop-in replacement for the [sqlite3](https://github.com/sparklemotion/sqlite3-ruby) gem for JRuby

- Passes the full sqlite3 test suite
- Works with Active Record without a custom adapter

[![Build Status](https://github.com/ankane/sqlite3-ruby-ffi/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ankane/sqlite3-ruby-ffi/actions)

## Installation

Add this line to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "sqlite3-ffi"
```

And use it the same way as the sqlite3 gem.

## Why FFI for JRuby?

I tried [JDBC](https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc), [JNI](https://sqlite.org/src/dir/ext/jni), and FFI. Since SQLite is written in C, all three approaches eventually call C, and FFI provides the most compatibility.

## Credits

This library uses code from the [sqlite3](https://github.com/sparklemotion/sqlite3-ruby) gem and is available under the same license.

The code in `lib` and `test` is an exact copy, plus some additional files:

- `lib/sqlite3/ffi/*` (port of `ext`)
- `lib/sqlite3/ffi.rb`
- `lib/sqlite3/sqlite3_native.rb`
- `test/ffi_helper.rb`
